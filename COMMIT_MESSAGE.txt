Breaking Changes:
- Go 1.22 and below are no longer supported
- CI/CD pipelines must be updated to use Go 1.23+
- Docker images should use golang:1.23-alpine or later

Compatibility:
- All existing code remains compatible (no API changes)
- Tests should pass without modification
- No application behavior changes expected

Documentation:
- Added SECURITY_UPDATES.md with detailed CVE analysis
- Added UPGRADE_GUIDE.md with step-by-step instructions
- Added UPDATE_NOTES.md with technical implementation details
- Added update-dependencies.sh automation script
- Added CHANGES_SUMMARY.txt for quick reference

Action Required:
1. Install Go 1.23 or higher for local development
2. Update CI/CD pipeline configurations
3. Run: go mod download && go test ./...
4. Review documentation in UPGRADE_GUIDE.md

Verification:
- [ ] Dependencies will be downloaded when network is available
- [ ] Tests should pass: go test ./...
- [ ] Security scan clean: govulncheck ./...
- [ ] CI/CD updated to Go 1.23+
